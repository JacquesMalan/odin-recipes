  <h1>Boneless Buffalo Wings</h1>
  <img src="../img/Boneless-Buffalo-Wings-3.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Come and try the legendary boneless buffalo wings!</h2>
  <p>These boneless wings are a great way to have chicken. I had these at a pub and fell in love with the taste. They're
    a nice change from your regular chicken wings. Serve with blue cheese dressing for dipping.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hot pepper sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <h4>Step 1</h4>
  <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
  <h4>Step 2</h4>
  <p>Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Whisk together egg
    and milk in a small bowl.</p>
  <h4>Step 3</h4>
  <p>Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. Repeat so that each piece of chicken is
    double-coated. Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes.</p>
  <h4>Step 4</h4>
  <p>Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read
    thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
  <h4>Step 5</h4>
  <p>Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds.
    Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat.</p>
