  <h2>Best sloppy Joe's, South of the Border!</h2>
  <p>This is a perfect recipe for anyone wanting to avoid spiciness and still enjoy a sloppy joe! I followed the recipe
    exactly, weighing the ketchup which amounted to 3/4 cup. This is truly "simple, quick, and tasty" as stated in the
    introductions.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped union</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped celery</li>
    <li>7 ounces ketchup</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>8 white or wheat hamburger buns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <h4>Step 1</h4>
  <p>Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into skillet; add onion and celery. Cook and stir
    beef mixture until beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.</p>
  <h4>Step 2</h4>
  <p>Stir ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, mustard, and lemon juice through the beef mixture. Reduce
    heat to medium-low and cook mixture at a simmer until mixture is hot and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes.</p>
